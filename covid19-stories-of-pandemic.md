## Introduction:
The ongoing global pandemic has had an impact on the daily lives everywhere the world over. Its onset was characterized by chaos as doctors, administrators and communities struggled to understand and address the novel coronavirus. 

As the world works to meet this challenge, the virus is still an unknown quantity for us. Doctors have worked tirelessly to develop treatments that can help those afflicted with the virus though a vaccine or cure still seems to be some time away. 

## Context: 
The virus has tested administrative capabilities and capacity across the board including those of governmental, media and medical agencies who, under different circumstances, would be responsible for documenting the impact of this virus including the devastating experiences of those affected by it. 

In many places the virus has been anathema. Patients and medical staff have been ostracized by their immediate communities which has served to further exacerbate their challenges. 

It has also been a unifying force prompting people to help those most vulnerable to the disease including the elderly, the daily wage earners, and essential workers at the frontline of this heroic struggle. 

This resource is an attempt to capture, document and record for posterity experiences of those who have contracted the virus, their friends and immediate families. 

## Questionnaire
This questionnaire seeks to understand the experience of patients and their family and friends from when they find out about the infection, the challenges they faced and the actions they took. 

Patients, healthcare workers and their families have been stigmatized because of the coronavirus infection. Such a strong response has had a significant impact on social support that would have otherwise been available. 

Thus, this project also seeks to understand the impact of immediate society on the overall experience of patients.
