Dear all,

I am reaching out to you seeking your views/responses to a set of questions I have. This is part of a study commissioned by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) on the accessibility of earth observation training data that can be used by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods. Please find the context, background, and questions as well. 

I would request you to kindly respond to the questions here: [Study on open access to Earth Observation (EO) training data](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPmIU8Oaap24qU1XTkl9DLWGUspqzGc7dUJ_ZnoOtNR8Ihvg/viewform). The form will be open for responses until 5 July 2021.

## Looking for Teaching Assistants for a course on data analysis for school students

Hi All- I am a new member, though I was a member of this group long ago (till 2014/15). I am more of an educator than an analytics person. We are starting an online course for 100 bright high school students by end July. We need 4-5 TAs (teaching assistants) to support the lead facilitator; am hoping that some of the newbies to data analysis on this group who like to teach will find the opportunity of interest. 

The note and the links below have more details.

Paid Opportunity to teach Data Science to highly able school students!

agastya.org is a leading not-for-profit in the space of school education, working on sparking curiosity and nurturing creativity among children. Agastya’s mission, supported by its funders and partners, also includes identifying and nurturing highly able children to meet their potential. genwise.in is a team of world-class mentors that offers programs and courses that provide children with both depth of understanding and breadth of perspective, supplementing the formal curriculum.

As part of Agastya’s larger initiative on mentoring highly able children, Agastya and GenWise are jointly launching a ‘Junior Data Scientists Club’. The first activity of this club will be a 6-week course for 100 high-school students, starting Jul 31, 2021.

This course presents a great opportunity to college students who are interested in statistics, data analytics, data visualization and teaching. Working with the lead instructor from GenWise and with the group of highly able children, you can hone your understanding of the basics of data science, inspire young children and be inspired yourself!

You should have a working knowledge of Excel and/or Google Spreadsheets, including the use of formulae and charts. For more details of your role and responsibilities and to apply, refer to https://bit.ly/TADataScienceAgastya
